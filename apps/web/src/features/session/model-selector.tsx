        ONE trailing slot, always the same 24px wide, so swapping what sits in
        it never shifts the name beside it and every row truncates at the same
        column. Two rules decide what sits in it:

        AT REST, being the selected model outranks being the default. The check
        answers "which model am I about to send to", which is the question the
        list is open to answer; the star answers "which one do new sessions
        start on", which is a setting. So a row that is BOTH shows the check —
        the star is one hover away.

        A default that is NOT the selected model has an empty slot to use, so it
        keeps its filled star at rest — otherwise nothing on screen would say
        which model your sessions actually start on.

        ── The swap is INSTANT, and that is deliberate ──

        This used to cross-fade: the star faded in over 150ms and the check
        faded out over 100ms. Dragging the cursor down the list left a trail of
        stars at every opacity between 0 and 1 — five or six rows mid-fade
        at once, none of them the row under the cursor. It read as flicker
        because it WAS flicker. Two causes, both fixed by removing the fade:

          1. FREQUENCY. This is a row you sweep past, not a surface you open. A
             150ms reveal is still running when the cursor is three rows further
             down, so the animation never describes where the pointer is.
          2. TWO TRIGGERS, ONE PROPERTY. The reveal fires from `:hover` AND from
             cmdk's `data-selected` (a pointermove loop; the CSS hover is the
             fallback for pages that swallow pointermove — see `command.tsx`).
             They do not drop together: hover ends when you leave,
             `data-selected` persists until another row claims it. Two sources
             easing one opacity in opposite directions is what "comes and goes
             and comes back" looks like.

        The row's own background swaps immediately from those same two
        triggers, so the star now matches the row it belongs to. What still
        animates is what cannot trail: colour and background on the icon the
        cursor is actually over, and the press scale. Do not put `opacity` back
        in that property list.

         who is not a member of the ACCOUNT — a project member need not be —
         and the SDK toasts a 403 by default. This selector's trigger renders
