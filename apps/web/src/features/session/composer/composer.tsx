 * The composer's outer shell — max width, centering, and the horizontal gutter

 *
 * The BASE gutter is `px-4` and it carries no breakpoint, deliberately. This
 * was `px-2 sm:px-0`, and `sm:` is a VIEWPORT query answering a CONTAINER
 * question. This element's width is set by the session layout — sidebar,
 * action-panel column, and the browser/terminal/files detail panel — never by
 * the window:
 *
 *  - Action panel or a detail tab open on a 1512px screen: the viewport is
 *    still ≥640px, so `sm:px-0` zeroed the gutter while the chat column was
 *    only ~600px wide. The column is narrower than `max-w-210`, so `mx-auto`
 *    has no slack to donate and the card sat flush against the panel divider.
 *  - Everything closed: the column grows past `max-w-210`, `mx-auto` produces
 *    slack on both sides, and the gutter appears to "work" again.
 *
 * Same class, opposite result, decided by a query that cannot see the panel —
 * which is exactly the "sometimes there's padding, sometimes there isn't" bug.
 * A constant gutter is correct in all of them: when the column is wide the
 * 16px is invisible inside the centering slack, and when it is narrow it is
 * the only thing keeping the card off the edge.
 *
 * 16px is not arbitrary — it is the transcript's own gutter (`session-chat.tsx`:
 * `mx-auto w-full max-w-3xl min-w-0 px-4 pt-6`). Whenever the column is
 * narrower than either max-width — every panel-open case — the card's edges
 * land on exactly the same rails as the messages above it.
 *
 * The gutter is equal on both sides. It used to carry `md:pr-1`, a right-side
 * trim against the collapsed action-panel chevron rail, which then took ~37px
 * of the row's width. That rail now takes no width (`COLLAPSED_RAIL_OFFSET` in
 * `session-action-panel-column.tsx`), so the trim only shifted the card 5.5px
 * right of center. A breakpoint may never ZERO this gutter — zero is what let
 * the card touch the panel divider, and `composer-underbar.test.tsx` guards
 * exactly that line.
 *
 * Do not add breakpoints. If this needs to respond to width,
 * it has to be a container query on the chat column, not a media query — the
 * media query cannot see the panel, which is the whole reason it broke before.
