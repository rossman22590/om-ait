/**
 * One user action = one submission — and the NEXT user action must survive.
 *
 * The latch's BEHAVIOR (immediately dispatch a typed second message, drop a same-tick
 * double-fire, release on throw) is asserted with real promises in
 * `submit-latch.test.ts`. The send behavior below runs the exported helpers
 * `composer.tsx` and its hosts call — `captureAttachmentSubmission`,
 * `runComposerSend`, `deliverAfterPaint`, `dispatchLatched`, `createSubmitLatch`
 * — so a regression in any of them fails here. Source assertions pin only the
 * wiring: which helper each call site uses.
 *
 * Source assertions, for the reason stated in `session-chat-queued-retry-id.test.ts`:
 * `apps/web` has no DOM harness, and the composer sits behind a `React.lazy`
 * boundary. Every slice goes through `between()`, which FAILS on a missing
 * anchor rather than yielding '' and passing.
 *
 * History: the first latch was an inline `if (submissionInFlight.current)
 * return;`. That blanket return held the gate for the entire await of the
 * previous send's ACK (seconds with uploads, ~30s against a waking sandbox)
 * and silently dropped every submission inside the window — the "second
 * message never queues, Enter does nothing" bug. The expectation this file
 * used to pin was that behavior; it changed on purpose.
