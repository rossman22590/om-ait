/**
 * WHICH turn is the one the agent is working on.
 *
 * It used to be "the last one", by definition — and that was true until a
 * prompt could be queued mid-turn. Now the transcript can end with one or
 * more user messages the agent has not reached yet: OpenCode persists a
 * queued prompt as a user message the moment the server forwards it, and
 * the agent picks it up between steps, minutes later. During that window
 * the LAST turn is a bubble with nothing under it, and the turn that is
 * actually streaming (with its "Thinking" burst, its tool calls) sits one
 * or more turns UP. Pinning the working indicator to the last turn painted
 * "Figuring out what's next…" under a message nobody had started, and left
 * the live turn looking settled.
 *
 * The rule, in order:
 *
 *  1. The working projection names a turn. This is the server's current turn
 *     or this tab's fresh send receipt. It outranks incomplete transcript
 *     metadata because message completion can arrive one frame late.
 *  2. The newest turn that has any assistant content. If its newest
 *     assistant message is still open (no `time.completed`), that is the
 *     working turn — the agent is visibly writing there. Older turns with an
 *     open assistant message are husks (a box that died mid-turn); the
 *     newest turn with content outranks them.
 *  3. Otherwise the NEWEST pending turn. OpenCode parents the next step to
 *     the latest user message and answers every queued message before it in
 *     that same step — so that is where the shimmer lands, and the ones
 *     before it are already taken (bright, no indicator of their own).
 *  4. No pending turns: the newest turn with content (its step just ended;
 *     the next one has not opened yet — the indicator stays put instead of
 *     flickering).
 *
 * `null` for an empty transcript — and for a transcript with no assistant
 * content at all whose every prompt the server is still holding: there is no
 * turn the agent is on, only pending ones.

 * fell back to the previous answer — then snapped forward again when the answer
 * opened. That is the double jump on send.
