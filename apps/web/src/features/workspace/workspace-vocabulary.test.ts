/**
 * Guards the product's ONE noun: a unit of work is a **project**, everywhere.
 *
 * This file used to enforce the opposite — "UI copy says Workspace, code
 * identifiers keep `project`". That split was a rename finished on the copy
 * layer only, and it is exactly why the product read as if it used two words
 * for one thing: the URL said `/projects/<id>`, the API said `/v1/projects`,
 * the CLI said `kortix projects`, `kortix.yaml` said `project:`, the DB said
 * `projects` — and the screen said "Workspace".
 *
 * "Project" won because it is the load-bearing one. Renaming the other
 * direction would mean renaming 163 exported names in a PUBLISHED package
 * (`packages/sdk`, where an exported name is a public API contract), every
 * REST route, 19 CLI subcommands, 30 route directories, the `projects` table,
 * and the `project:` block in every customer's committed manifest. Renaming
 * the copy costs a translation sweep and this file.
 *
 * It also removes a real collision: "workspace" still means three other
 * things in this repo — the sandbox working directory `/workspace`, the
 * manifest's per-agent `workspace:` git-boundary key, and a Slack workspace.
 * Those are NOT this noun and must keep saying workspace.
 *
 * Two describe blocks, deliberately paired: the first asserts ABSENCE (no
 * "Workspace" leaks back into the copy), the second asserts PRESENCE (the
 * project copy is actually rendered). Absence alone cannot tell "says
 * Project" apart from "says nothing" — a regression that deletes a label or
 * breaks a conditional so a branch never mounts would leave absence green.
