/**
 * The product must always offer a LIVE, discoverable way to create an account.
 *
 * It stopped offering one. Every affordance still existed in the tree and none
 * of them rendered:
 *
 * - `features/layout/account-switcher.tsx` carries a "New account" row and
 *   mounts `CreateAccountModal`, but its only render site is
 *   `features/layout/app-header.tsx`, and `AppHeader` has no render site at
 *   all — the accounts layout was replaced by `AccountSettingsShell`, which
 *   never mounts it. Dead code cannot be an entry point.
 * - `features/accounts/hub/account-list-content.tsx` carries the other one. It
 *   renders only for `hubTarget(null)` (`?accountId=` with no value), and every
 *   live caller opens the hub ON an account, so the list pane was reachable
 *   only by opening Account settings and clicking the hub's root breadcrumb.
 *
 * So the guard cannot be "the string exists somewhere" — that was true the
 * whole time it was broken. It has to be pinned to a surface that provably
 * renders: the project sidebar's workspace switcher, which `ProjectSidebar`
 * mounts on every `/projects/[id]` route.
