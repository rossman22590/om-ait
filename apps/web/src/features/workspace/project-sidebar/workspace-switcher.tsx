/**
 * The project sidebar's one control: which workspace you are in, and everything
 * you can do from here.
 *
 * It is a WORKSPACE switcher, not a user menu — the distinction is the whole
 * point of the component existing separately from `UserMenu` in the app header.
 * The trigger shows the workspace, not you: its icon (an emoji if one is set,
 * otherwise the initials `EntityAvatar` derives from the name) and its name, the
 * same treatment the rows inside the switcher use, so the thing you are in looks
 * like the things you can move to. No account name, no email, no avatar — you
 * already know who you are; what a sidebar has to tell you is where you are.
 *
 * User settings opens the same settings surface the header `UserMenu` opens,
 * on the same `profile` tab — but by a different mechanism, and the difference
 * is not cosmetic. This control only ever renders under `ProjectShell`, which
 * mounts `SettingsPanel` as a sibling (`project-shell.tsx:195`), so poking
 * `useSettingsPanelStore.openSettings(tab)` has a renderer subscribed and the
 * overlay opens in place. `UserMenu` mounts only in the app header under the
 * `app/(app)/accounts` tree, where no `SettingsPanel` exists, so its rows
 * navigate to `/settings/<tab>` instead. `main` authored this row against the
 * deleted `SidePanelUserSettings` modal; this branch replaced that modal with
 * the panel (JAY-498), so the row was repointed rather than dropped.
 * Account settings (`/accounts/:id`) is reached from the "Switch Workspace"
 * submenu, at the top of it, above the workspace list — see
 * `workspace-menu-section.tsx`. That is the one view in this menu already
 * grouped BY account, so it is the only place where "which account" is not a
 * guess. This top-level menu stays about the user and the workspace.
 *
 * The rows that are genuinely account-level and have nowhere else to live in
 * this panel — Install App, Theme, Help, Log out — are shared with `UserMenu`
 * through `user-menu-shared.tsx` rather than copied.
 *
 * This replaced three controls: a `<Link>` carrying the Kortix mark fused to a
 * separate dropdown trigger carrying the workspace name, plus a user menu in the
 * sidebar footer. Two of the three were dropdowns, and the fused one made you
 * guess which half you were pointing at — the left half navigated, the right
 * half disclosed.
