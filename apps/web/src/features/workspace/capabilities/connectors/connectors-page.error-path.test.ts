/**
 * A source-assertion tripwire, in the shape of
 * `connector-tools.write-path.test.ts`.
 *
 * The page runs TWO queries and every flag read off the second one FAILS
 * CLOSED. `getProjectDetail` returning 500 leaves `experimental` undefined, so
 * `discoverEnabled` and `emailChannelEnabled` are both false, and two things
 * change with no error and no way back:
 *
 *   - the catalogue silently falls back from Discover to Easy Connect
 *     (`useCatalog`)
 *   - the custom-connector form loses its email-channel branch
 *     (`emailChannelEnabled`)
 *
 * react-query drops `isLoading` once a query has exhausted its retries, so the
 * page rendered as fully loaded and healthy while degraded. This is the third
 * time on this branch that a capability went silently absent behind a
 * condition nothing asserted, so the coupling is pinned rather than trusted.
 *
 * The fallback is now a deliberate feature rather than a failure mode — see
 * `use-catalog.ts` — but it must still be *reached* through a flag that came
 * from a query whose failure the page reports.
