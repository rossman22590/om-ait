 * stay separate (`…/channels/*` vs `…/connectors/*`) and no data model was

 *
 * `?scope=` is the tab, so every scope is linkable — which is what lets the
 * retired `/projects/<id>/channels` route redirect to a real destination
 * instead of a page that lands on Discovery and hides what was asked for.
 *

 * GraphQL / MCP / HTTP). Everything the Add-connector modal used to hide

 * catalogue cards, Channels as catalogue entries alongside them. A modal is

                Text, not a chip. This row already carries the tab strip's
                filled control; a second bordered pill opposite it would read as
                a second selector rather than a way out to a settings surface.
                `variant="text"` is the codebase's muted-text affordance
                (`text-muted-foreground` → `text-primary` on hover); `px-0` drops
                the pill padding so the label sits flush with the container's
                right edge, mirroring the tab strip flush left. It keeps the
                full `h-8` of `size="sm"` as its hit area.

                `ml-auto` rather than leaning on the shell's `justify-between`:
                when the row wraps on a narrow viewport this lands alone on the
                second line, and `justify-between` would drop it to the LEFT
                there. `ml-auto` holds it right in both layouts.

                Not gated on `canWrite` — anyone who can open the page can read
                the project's approval policy. */}
