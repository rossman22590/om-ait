 * in-page exit — `/new`, `/checkout`, a loading frame, an auth status screen —
 * has nothing to click, so the user is stuck on it. This is the missing toolbar
 * button, drawn in the title-bar band. The shell's Go menu (Back ⌘[, Forward
 * ⌘], Home ⇧⌘H, apps/desktop-electron/src/navigation.js) backs it up on pages
 * the web app does not render.
 *
 * It renders on every platform. `.kx-desktop-back` in globals.css shows it only
 * under `html[data-desktop='true']`, so the web keeps the browser's own Back.
 * Gating in CSS instead of in React keeps server and client markup identical:
 * `DESKTOP_INIT_SCRIPT` sets the attribute before first paint.

 * used: it counts cross-origin entries, and Electron's `will-navigate` gate
 * does not run for history traversal, so Back would load GitHub inside the app
