/**
 * Shell for every authenticated app route.
 *
 * Its only job is to host behaviour that must not depend on WHICH app route the
 * user happens to be on. Returning from Stripe is the first such case: the
 * handling used to live in the projects list page, which forced every checkout
 * `success_url` to point at `/projects` — the one surface that is deliberately
 * never a destination. Ending a workspace switch is the second: the picker that
 * starts one closes immediately, and the route it navigates to is a different
 * one on either side, so only a shell above both can watch it land.
 *
 * The account hub overlay is the third such case. It opens over whatever app
 * route you are on — a project, a session, the projects list — so only a
 * shell above all of them can mount it. It renders nothing until something
 * opens it, and it stands down entirely while an `/accounts/**` route is
 * showing the same surface. See `features/accounts/hub/account-hub-panel.tsx`.
 *
 * Keep this thin. Route-specific work belongs in the route.
