/**
 * Agent-led project config authoring (web parity:
 * components/projects/customize/use-configure-thread.ts).
 *
 * Project config (agents / skills) lives in the repo and is
 * read-only from the UI — the only way to change it is through a session that
 * edits the files on a branch and opens a change request. "New" and "Edit"
 * therefore don't write files directly: they start a fresh session seeded with
 * one of these prompts; the session auto-sends it once the runtime is ready and
 * the agent takes it from there.
