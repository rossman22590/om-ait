/**
 * Expand/collapse choices for the rows of an assistant turn — thought rows,
 * file-chip runs, tool rows, and error stack traces.
 *
 * apps/web keeps this in component state (`userToggled` ref + `useState`). A
 * mobile transcript is a FlatList, and a recycled or re-mounted cell loses
 * component state, so a row the user opened would snap shut on scroll. The
 * store holds ONLY the user's explicit choice; the automatic state (open while
 * running) is computed on render, and `resolveDisclosureOpen` in
 * `./activity.ts` combines the two.
