 * navigate: a warm link keeps the current screen, a cold start begins at the
 * splash screen.
 *
 * In-app browser return URLs (`kortix://providers/…`, `kortix://connectors/…`,
 * `kortix://connections/…`) only close the browser session. On Android they
 * also arrive as a deep link; the same rule keeps the user on the screen that
 * opened the browser.
