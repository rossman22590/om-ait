/**
 * ProjectRoutes — the screens of the stack inside `/projects/[id]`.
 *
 * A project is a stack over one home, so back always has a place to land:
 *   /projects/[id]          index    — project home (greeting, composer)
 *   /projects/[id]/view     view     — every other project state: a tool page
 *                                      (Files, Agents, …), a thread, or a
 *                                      session that is still connecting
 *   /projects/[id]/sessions sessions — every session of the project (drawer)
 *   /projects/[id]/files    files    — the project's files (drawer)
 *   /projects/[id]/account  account  — the Account page (drawer avatar)
 *   /projects/[id]/page     page     — a sub-page (`?pageId=`), pushed over
 *                                      the page it was opened from: project
 *                                      Settings from Settings, Schedules or
 *                                      Secrets from project Settings
 *
 * The stack is `[index]`, `[index, X]`, or `[index, X, page, …]`. The
 * drawer never deepens it: it pushes `sessions`, `files`, or `account` over
 * home, replaces a covering route with them, and drops any sub-pages
 * (lib/session/project-stack, ProjectScreen). A covering route replaces
 * itself with the view when a session opens (useCoveringRoute). Every
 * project page shows the hamburger and the drawer opens from its left edge,
 * except a sub-page: it shows Go back, and its left edge goes back.
 *
 * Back: a sub-page pops one level (Go back, Android back, iOS swipe-back),
 * to the screen it was opened from, whose state is intact (it stayed
 * mounted under the sub-page). Android back from a covering route returns
 * to project home. Back from project home never leaves the project (see
 * ProjectScreen).
 *
 * ProjectScreen is the `[id]` layout. It owns the connect engine, the drawer,
 * the sheets and the tab-store scope, and gives home and view their content
 * through ProjectRouteProvider. The tab store still decides WHICH page or
 * thread shows. The routes mirror only whether the project is on its home:
 *   - home route: the store leaves the home state → push `view`
 *   - covering route (sessions, files, account): the store leaves the home
 *     state → replace this route with `view`
 *   - view route: the store returns to the home state (deleted session, New
 *     session) → pop to home
 *   - view route removed (pop, replace, leaving the project) → reset the
 *     store to the home state, before the route leaves the navigation state,
 *     so the home route never sees "not home" with no view to show it

 * A route that covers project home: `sessions`, `files`, or `account`. Call it

 * row in the drawer, a notification), the route replaces itself with `view`.
 * No push: the stack stays `[index, view]`.
 *
 * Returns `openSession`, for a session list on the route (Sessions page). It
 * opens once per route instance, and the stack ends as [index, view] with one
 * push transition:

 *      push. No view route is removed, so its `beforeRemove` and unmount
 *      cleanup (both call goHome) never run.
 * The reverse order can mount the view while the store is still home. The view
 * then pops at once and home pushes it again: two transitions.
 *
 * On project home or on the view itself, only the store changes: home pushes
 * the view, and an open view swaps its content. Never replace the view with a
 * new view: the old view's cleanup would reset the store and close the
 * session that just opened.
 *
 * A covering route must not reset the store on `beforeRemove`: replace removes
 * it after step 1.
