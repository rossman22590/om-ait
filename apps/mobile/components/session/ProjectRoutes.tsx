/**
 * ProjectRoutes — the screens of the stack inside `/projects/[id]`.
 *
 * A project is a stack over one home, so back always has a place to land:
 *   /projects/[id]          index    — project home (greeting, composer)
 *   /projects/[id]/view     view     — every other project state: a tool page
 *                                      (Files, Agents, …), a thread, or a
 *                                      session that is still connecting
 *   /projects/[id]/sessions sessions — every session of the project (drawer)
 *   /projects/[id]/files    files    — the project's files (drawer)
 *   /projects/[id]/account  account  — the Account page (drawer avatar)
 *
 * The stack is never deeper than one screen over project home: `[index]` or
 * `[index, X]`. Every project page shows the hamburger, and the drawer opens
 * on every project route. The drawer pushes `sessions`, `files`, or `account`
 * over home, and replaces a covering route with them
 * (lib/session/project-stack, ProjectScreen). A covering route replaces
 * itself with the view when a session opens (useCoveringRoute).
 *
 * Back: Android back from a covering route returns to project home. iOS has
 * no swipe-back in this stack: the left edge opens the drawer. Back from
 * project home never leaves the project (see ProjectScreen); only the
 * project menu's All projects opens the Projects list.
 *
 * ProjectScreen is the `[id]` layout. It owns the connect engine, the drawer,
 * the sheets and the tab-store scope, and gives home and view their content
 * through ProjectRouteProvider. The tab store still decides WHICH page or
 * thread shows. The routes mirror only whether the project is on its home:
 *   - home route: the store leaves the home state → push `view`
 *   - covering route (sessions, files, account): the store leaves the home
 *     state → replace this route with `view`
 *   - view route: the store returns to the home state (deleted session, New
 *     session) → pop to home
 *   - view route removed (pop, replace, leaving the project) → reset the
 *     store to the home state, before the route leaves the navigation state,
 *     so the home route never sees "not home" with no view to show it

/**
 * A route that covers project home: `sessions`, `files`, or `account`. Call it
 * once in the component the route renders: `useNavigation()` there is the
 * project stack.
 *
 * When the store leaves the home state while this route is focused (a session
 * row in the drawer, a notification), the route replaces itself with `view`.
 * No push: the stack stays `[index, view]`.
 *
 * Returns `openSession`, for a session list on the route (Sessions page). It
 * opens once per route instance, and the stack ends as [index, view] with one
 * push transition:
 *   1. openProjectSession(session) — the store leaves the home state first.
 *      Home is not focused (this route covers it), so ProjectHomeRoute does
 *      not push a second view.
 *   2. replace this route with `view` — the view mounts with the store already
 *      off home, so ProjectViewRoute does not pop itself. Replace animates as a
 *      push. No view route is removed, so its `beforeRemove` and unmount
 *      cleanup (both call goHome) never run.
 * The reverse order can mount the view while the store is still home. The view
 * then pops at once and home pushes it again: two transitions.
 *
 * On project home or on the view itself, only the store changes: home pushes
 * the view, and an open view swaps its content. Never replace the view with a
 * new view: the old view's cleanup would reset the store and close the
 * session that just opened.
 *
 * A covering route must not reset the store on `beforeRemove`: replace removes
 * it after step 1.
