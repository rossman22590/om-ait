/**
 * The "Continue closes the sheet first, then the hand-off runs" pattern —
 * Paper board 08's close-then-open rule ("never two overlays"), factored out
 * of `ConnectProviderSheet` so `ConnectorAuthSheet` (COR-158's connector
 * hand-off) reuses it instead of duplicating the pendingRef dance.
 *
 * `run` fires from the sheet's own `onDismiss`, once, and ONLY when the
 * dismiss followed a Continue tap — a swipe-to-close or "Not now" never fires
 * it. The sheet component itself stays mounted the whole time (a permanent
 * sibling of the composer), so `run`'s closures over its own props are
 * unaffected by the *modal* dismissing — only `pendingRef` distinguishes the
 * two kinds of dismiss.
