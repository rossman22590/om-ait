/**
 * Honest, actionable copy for EVERY non-success outcome of starting a session
 * from a chat channel — surfaced in the conversation instead of a generic "try
 * again", so a real blocker tells the user exactly what to do. Every error
 * shape the create path (createProjectSession + the session lifecycle) can
 * return is mapped here: most-specific by `code`, then by HTTP status, then a
 * safe generic fallback.
 *
 * Shared by Slack and Teams. The classification is identical on both — only the
 * command a user is pointed at differs, so each platform passes its own
 * `StartErrorCommands`. Before this was shared, Teams had a four-branch copy of
 * its own (402 / 429 / 404 / generic): every code case and 400, 403, 409 and
 * 5xx collapsed to "give it a moment and send your message again", which is
 * actively wrong advice for a dead sandbox template or a missing account link —
 * retrying hits the same wall forever.
 *
 * The AGENT_NOT_DECLARED case is handled by its own inline-picker branch at the
 * call sites — it needs an interactive card, not a text line — so it never
 * reaches here.
 *
 * Pure + dependency-free (mirrors slack/errors.ts) so it's unit-tested in
 * isolation, with no config/DB import to boot. Keep it exhaustive: an unmapped
 * status must still read sensibly and always leave the user a next step.
