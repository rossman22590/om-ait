/**
 * Releasing a channel session's blocking `question` call, from the server.
 *
 * The agent's `question` tool blocks until answered. In a chat channel the
 * answer arrives later as an ordinary message — a NEW turn — so the call must
 * be released with a sentinel or the turn hangs until the box is parked.
 *
 * That used to happen only inside the sandbox, gated on SLACK_THREAD_TS /
 * SLACK_CHANNEL_ID in BOTH harnesses (open-code/boot.ts and pi/relay.ts). A
 * Teams session carries MS_TEAMS_* instead, so a Teams agent that asked a
 * question hung after its card was posted. The daemons are image-baked, so
 * fixing them reaches only new sandboxes.
 *
 * This runs in `POST /turn-question`, which both harnesses already call with
 * the runtime's own question id. It reaches every existing sandbox on the next
 * API deploy, and it is harness-agnostic: real OpenCode and the pi harness both
 * serve `POST /question/:id/reply` with the same contract.
 *
 * It also fixes Slack. The old daemon's Slack sentinel ended with "Next time,
 * just ask with `slack send` rather than the question tool" — the opposite of
 * what the Slack turn prompt now tells the agent. The server releases FIRST
 * (inside the request the daemon is still awaiting), so its sentinel is the one
 * the agent reads; the daemon's own late release returns 404 and is ignored.
