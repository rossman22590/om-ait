/**
 * The inbound audit scope: one per request that reaches the API process.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The audit log used to be opt-in in four independent ways, so every new
 * surface started out dark:
 *
 *  1. `auditApiRequest` wrote a row only when a route had put a user or an
 *     account on the Hono context. Anything that authenticated its own
 *     credential was skipped without a trace — the Git proxy wrote no row for
 *     a clone or a push until #7507 patched it by hand.
 *  2. It was mounted on `/v1/*`, so `/scim/v2` never passed through it.
 *  3. Preview subdomains, deployed-app origins, the tunnel WebSocket and the
 *     PTY terminal WebSocket are dispatched by `Bun.serve.fetch` before Hono
 *     sees the request, so they had no row and no request context at all.
 *  4. Every explicit `recordAuditEvent` call had to pass the actor by hand.
 *
 * ## The model
 *
 * The outermost layer that sees a request opens ONE scope and writes ONE row
 * when the response is known — unconditionally, except for the probe and
 * preflight noise named in {@link isUnauditedInbound}. In production that
 * layer is `Bun.serve.fetch` (`shared/audit-edge.ts`); a test that drives the
 * Hono app directly gets the same row from `auditApiRequest`.
 *
 * Everything that learns something about the request writes INTO the scope:
 *
 *  - an authenticator that resolved a caller calls {@link bindAuditPrincipal};
 *  - a handler that knows the domain meaning calls {@link annotateAuditEvent}
 *    (`git.push` with its refs, instead of `POST …/git-receive-pack`);
 *  - the dispatcher that classified the request calls
 *    {@link setInboundAuditEntrypoint}.
 *
 * A request nobody bound is still written, as `actor_type: 'anonymous'`. A
 * missing binding therefore shows up as an unattributed row, never as a
 * missing one.
 *
 * This module is a LEAF: it imports only the request context. Eleven test
 * files replace `shared/audit` wholesale with `mock.module`, so authenticators
 * import their binding API from here, never from `shared/audit`.
