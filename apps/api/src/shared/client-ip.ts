/**
 * The caller's address, for rate limiting.
 *
 * `X-Forwarded-For` is a list that every proxy APPENDS to. The client writes
 * whatever it likes into the header first, so the LEFTMOST entry is chosen by
 * the caller and never identifies it. Reading it gave every request a fresh
 * rate-limit bucket for the price of a random header.
 *
 * The rule: the client is the entry `KORTIX_TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` places from the
 * RIGHT. Each trusted proxy appended exactly one entry, so the entries to the
 * right of the client were written by infrastructure and the entries to its
 * left were written by the client.
 *
 *   Cloud (Cloudflare, then the ALB, both append):  [spoofed…, client, cf-edge]
 *   hops = 2 → `client`.
 *
 *   Self-host (Caddy replaces an untrusted header):  [client]
 *   A chain shorter than `hops` holds only proxy-written entries, so its
 *   leftmost entry is the client.
 *
 * A wrong hop count degrades in one of two directions. Too low: the caller is a
 * proxy address, so many clients share one bucket. Too high: the caller is a
 * client-written entry, which is the old behaviour. Neither is a new exposure.
