# Billing v2 — Extensive Testing Plan

A complete checklist organized by subsystem. Each test includes setup, action,
and verification SQL. Run in order top-down for a full sweep; cherry-pick by
area for regression testing.

---

## Pre-test setup

Run these once before starting any test pass.

```bash
# 1. DB schema up-to-date
PGPASSWORD=postgres psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 54322 -U postgres -d postgres \
  -c "SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema='kortix' AND table_name='credit_accounts' AND column_name IN ('billing_model','seat_count','auto_topup_customized');"
# Expected: 3 rows

# 2. Stripe webhook listener running
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8008/v1/billing/webhooks/stripe
# Keep this terminal open during all tests

# 3. API running with the right env
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_BILLING_ENABLED=true in apps/web/.env
# - STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_* in apps/api/.env
# - STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET matches what `stripe listen` printed

# 4. Test users in Supabase auth
# At minimum: 2 fresh yopmail accounts (owner + invitee)
```

## K. Data integrity invariants

Run these as SQL audits — should return 0 rows in all cases:

```sql
-- K1: No orphaned compute sessions (sandbox no longer exists)
SELECT scs.id FROM kortix.sandbox_compute_sessions scs
LEFT JOIN kortix.session_sandboxes ss ON ss.sandbox_id = scs.sandbox_id
WHERE ss.sandbox_id IS NULL AND scs.state = 'active';

-- K2: No YOLO tokens for non-members
SELECT yt.user_id FROM kortix.yolo_member_tokens yt
LEFT JOIN kortix.account_members am ON am.user_id = yt.user_id AND am.account_id = yt.account_id
WHERE am.user_id IS NULL AND yt.revoked_at IS NULL;

-- K3: seat_count diverged from member count
SELECT ca.account_id, ca.seat_count, COUNT(am.*) AS actual_members
FROM kortix.credit_accounts ca
LEFT JOIN kortix.account_members am ON am.account_id = ca.account_id
WHERE ca.billing_model = 'per_seat'
GROUP BY ca.account_id, ca.seat_count
HAVING ca.seat_count <> COUNT(am.*);

-- K4: per_seat accounts without a YOLO token for the owner
SELECT ca.account_id FROM kortix.credit_accounts ca
WHERE ca.billing_model = 'per_seat'
  AND ca.stripe_subscription_id IS NOT NULL
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM kortix.yolo_member_tokens yt
    WHERE yt.account_id = ca.account_id AND yt.revoked_at IS NULL
  );

-- K5: Ledger balance reconciliation — sum of ledger should match wallet
SELECT ca.account_id, ca.balance, COALESCE(SUM(cl.amount), 0) AS ledger_sum
FROM kortix.credit_accounts ca
LEFT JOIN kortix.credit_ledger cl ON cl.account_id = ca.account_id
WHERE ca.account_id IN (...)  -- limit to test accounts
GROUP BY ca.account_id, ca.balance
HAVING ABS(ca.balance - COALESCE(SUM(cl.amount), 0)) > 0.01;

-- K6: Duplicate Stripe event processed
SELECT stripe_event_id, COUNT(*) FROM kortix.credit_ledger
WHERE stripe_event_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY stripe_event_id HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

## L. Performance / load tests

Optional but worth running before prod:

| #  | Scenario                              | How                                                            | Expected                                                                |
| -- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| L1 | 100 simultaneous webhook events       | `stripe events resend` × 100 with `&`                          | Webhook dedup holds, no double-grants                                   |
| L2 | 50 sandboxes started in 1 minute      | Script spinning sessions in parallel                           | All metering rows created; cron tick handles them all                   |
| L3 | Member add storm (10 members in 60s)  | Script invites                                                 | Stripe quantity converges; no orphan rows                                |
| L4 | Daily ledger growth                    | Run a week with 10 active sandboxes                            | Query latency for `getUsageBreakdownThisPeriod` stays sub-100ms          |

## M. Automated test suite

Already in place — run before every push:

```bash
cd apps/api
bun test src/__tests__/billing/per-seat-pricing.test.ts \
         src/__tests__/billing/e2e-compute-metering.test.ts \
         src/__tests__/billing/e2e-per-seat-webhooks.test.ts \
         src/__tests__/billing/credits.test.ts \
         src/__tests__/billing/subscriptions.test.ts \
         src/__tests__/billing/webhooks.test.ts
```

**Coverage gap (recommended next):**

- E2E test for `seat-management.ts:onMemberAdded` / `onMemberRemoved` (the file I never wrote)
- E2E test for `usage-breakdown.ts` aggregation correctness
- E2E test for legacy guard (account with `billing_model='legacy'` should no-op everywhere)
- E2E test for the new owner-token mint at subscription start

---

## N. Pre-deploy checklist (cloud / prod)

Before flipping `INTERNAL_KORTIX_ENV=prod`:

- [ ] Create prod `per_seat` Stripe price ($20/mo) under prod product
- [x] Prod per-seat price set: price_1TcrQJG6l1KZGqIry1K1cqZY (live "Kortix seat" $20/mo)
- [ ] Configure prod webhook endpoint in Stripe Dashboard pointing at prod API URL
- [ ] Copy prod webhook signing secret into prod env's `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- [ ] Verify `INTERNAL_KORTIX_ENV=prod` → `ensureSchema()` is a no-op (managed externally)
- [ ] Apply all migrations (88-92) via your prod migration pipeline (NOT auto-push)
- [ ] Verify no schema collisions with prod's actual migration state
- [ ] Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_BILLING_ENABLED=true` on the prod web build
- [ ] Confirm legacy customer cohort sample: their `billing_model='legacy'` is preserved after migration runs
- [ ] Smoke test in staging: full subscribe + member add cycle works end-to-end
- [ ] Document the legacy → per_seat manual migration procedure for support

---

## O. Post-deploy verification (first 24h)

Run hourly:

```sql
-- New per_seat signups in last hour
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM kortix.credit_accounts
WHERE billing_model = 'per_seat' AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';

-- Successful subscriptions in last hour
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM kortix.credit_accounts
WHERE billing_model = 'per_seat' AND stripe_subscription_id IS NOT NULL
  AND updated_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';

-- Failed Stripe webhook deliveries (check Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks)

-- Any data integrity violations (run K1-K6 above)

-- Auto-topup failures
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM kortix.credit_accounts
WHERE payment_status = 'failed' AND last_payment_failure > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
```

---

## P. Manual smoke test — full happy path (15 minutes)

The shortest end-to-end run-through to verify nothing's regressed:

1. ✅ Fresh signup (email A) → see CTA → subscribe → balance $20, seat 1
2. ✅ Invite email B (new user) → email sent → accept → seat 2 → balance $40
3. ✅ As B, open the workspace → see project → start a sandbox → chat for 5 min
4. ✅ Stop the sandbox → `compute_debit` lands → balance < $40
5. ✅ As A, remove B → seat 1 → B's token revoked
6. ✅ As A, cancel subscription → tier reverts → next page load shows CTA again

If all six steps pass, billing-v2 is healthy.

---

## Out of scope (separate work)

- **Mobile/RevenueCat per-seat support** — mobile customers stay on existing per-account tiers; per-seat is web-only at launch
- **Annual / yearly commitments on per-seat** — monthly only for now
- **Admin tools** for legacy→per-seat migration, manual balance adjustments
- **LLM router → `deductForLlmUsage` wiring** — the function exists but isn't called yet; needs router-side integration to land `llm_debit` entries
- **Reporting/analytics dashboards** for finance team — different surface, not user-facing billing

---

## Release-cycle recommendation

- **Pre-commit:** automated test suite (M)
- **Pre-merge:** P (full smoke test)
- **Pre-deploy to staging:** A, B, C, D, E (core flows)
- **Pre-deploy to prod:** N checklist + run K (integrity audits) against staging data
- **Post-deploy:** O monitoring for first 24h, plus G (legacy protection) audit weekly
