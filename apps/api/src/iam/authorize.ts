/**
 * THE canonical authorization engine. One function, one fixed precedence, ten
 * steps, reading only the canonical stores.
 *
 * REPLACES `iam/engine-v2.ts` (authorizeV2, resolveActorV2, loadProjectRoleRows,
 * deriveEffectiveProjectRole, customPolicyAllows, computeTokenScope,
 * agentGrantGates, listAccessibleProjectsV2, filterAccessibleProjectResources),
 * `projects/access.ts` (effectiveProjectRole, roleAllows,
 * foldEffectiveProjectAccess) and `iam/resource-grants.ts`'s fold
 * (isProjectResourceUsableByMember, isResourceAccessible, …) — four independent
 * copies of the max-role fold and three parallel permission vocabularies.
 *
 * WHAT IT READS
 *   kortix.role_assignments  every grant: membership, project roles, group
 *                            grants, custom-role bindings, object grants
 *   kortix.iam_roles         (canonical name: kortix.roles) system + custom roles
 *   kortix.iam_role_actions  (canonical name: kortix.role_permissions)
 *   kortix.permissions       the action catalog + its scope classifier
 *   kortix.object_policies   the unscoped-object default, per object type
 *
 * WHAT IT ALSO READS, AND WHY THAT IS NOT A LEGACY DEPENDENCY
 *   account_members.is_super_admin  a hard, audited bypass, deliberately NOT a
 *     role (spec §1). 22,408 of 33,363 local membership rows carry it, so
 *     turning it into an assignment would start evaluating folds that have been
 *     dead for two thirds of principals.
 *   accounts.mfa_required           an account setting, not a permission.
 *   account_group_members           (canonical name: kortix.group_members) —
 *     group MEMBERSHIP, which is an identity fact, not a grant.
 *   service_accounts                the principal must exist and be active.
 * It reads NONE of project_members, project_group_grants, iam_policies,
 * iam_resource_grants or account_members.account_role.
