// What the agent reads when a user answers its question on a card. The tap
// becomes a synthetic message that starts the next turn, so its wording is
// the agent's only evidence of what happened.
//
// A one-tap answer used to arrive as "<question>\n<answer>": the agent's own
// question, unmarked, followed by a bare label — which reads exactly like the
// user asking the question and then answering it. Slack has always framed it
// ("Answering your question \"…\":"); these pin Teams to the same framing.
