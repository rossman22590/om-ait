/**

 *
 * TWO callers need this, for one reason. On a box running opencode <= 1.18.14
 * (the baked 1.17.11 on every image built before 2026-08-20) the loop resolves
 * "has this prompt already been answered?" by ID ORDER, so an id that sorts
 * below what is on record is accepted and then silently never runs. From
 * 1.18.15 the exit test is `lastAssistant.parentID === lastUser.id` and a low
 * id no longer drops the prompt — but it still places the message BELOW the
 * answer on screen, because `MessageV2.page()` orders by `time_created` then
 * `id` in both versions. Re-minting is required on the old boxes and is
 * cosmetic-but-still-wanted on the new ones:
 *
 *  - a REDELIVERY: the abandoned attempt may already have persisted its user
 *    message, and repeating that id reads as already answered;
 *  - a prompt that WAITED: the client minted its id when the user pressed
 *    Enter, and the turn it queued behind has been writing higher ids ever
 *    since. This is the ordinary case, not the exotic one — it is what "queue
 *    while busy" does on every single send.
 *
 * Persisted into `payload.redeliveredMessageId` BEFORE delivery, so a crash
 * between mint and POST reuses one id rather than minting a second.
 *
 * A FAILED transcript read still mints rather than blocking the prompt — but it
 * must not mint blind. `mintWireMessageId` backdates by `WIRE_ID_BACKDATE_MS`
 * (2 min) on purpose: too early is self-correcting when there IS a transcript
 * to lift against. With no transcript there is nothing to lift against, and
 * OpenCode mints its own ids from a raw `Date.now()` with no backdate — so the
 * fallback would land two minutes BELOW every message the box wrote in the last
 * two minutes, which is the exact silent drop this function exists to prevent.
 * The un-backdated clock is the floor instead. An unreadable box is also the
 * commonest trigger for a redelivery, so this path is not the exotic one.
