/**
 * The inbox's admission gate.
 *
 * ONE QUEUED MESSAGE RUNS AT A TIME, IN ORDER, AND EACH GETS ITS OWN ANSWER.
 * A prompt sits in `session_lifecycle_commands` until the session's turn is
 * over AND every older prompt has left the delivery path. The first Quick
 * Queue prompt may end that turn after its current tool call finishes. Queue
 * List prompts wait for natural turn completion.
 *
 * The turn half is not belt-and-braces on the order half — it is the whole
 * feature. OpenCode picks up new user messages at STEP boundaries INSIDE a
 * running turn, and it "parents each step on the newest user message and
 * answers everything before it in that step" (`forwarded-placement.ts`). So
 * every prompt forwarded into a live turn is merged into whatever step reaches
 * it: two queued messages share one answer, and the earlier one is simply
 * never spoken. Measured 2026-09-04 — a 13-step research turn with "tell me
 * HI" and "tell me bye" queued behind it produced exactly one reply, "bye".
 *
 * Forwarding mid-turn was tried (`4ee30a9c3b`) to remove the gap between
 * queued messages. It bought that merge. The gap it was removing is gone by
 * other means: `promoteNextInboxRow` is AWAITED on the daemon's own
 * `session.idle` relay (`routes/r4.ts`, "THE TURN ENDED — the session's next
 * queued prompt is admissible NOW"), and the backoff below is now a 2s-capped
 * fallback rather than the 30s ceiling that produced the measured dead air.
 * A queued message therefore goes out on the turn-end event, not on a clock.
 *
 * WAITING IS NOT POLLING. A refused row does not sit out a backoff clock: the
 * instant the turn ends, `promoteNextInboxRow` makes the session's next row due
 * and drains it. The reaper is a recovery wake. The backoff below only covers
 * the gap a lost kick would leave, so it stays cheap and capped — 30s here
 * compounded to 27s / 45s / 75s of dead air behind ~1s deliveries (dev,
 * 2026-08-18).
 *
 * A refusal is NOT a failure: see `requeueForAdmission`, which gives the claim's
 * attempt increment back so waiting cannot burn the 5-attempt dead-letter budget.

 * gap a lost kick would leave. 30s here was the entire "queue does not send
