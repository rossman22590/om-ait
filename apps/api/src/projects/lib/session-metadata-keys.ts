/**
 * Session-metadata keys that only the server writes.
 *
 * `project_sessions.metadata` is one jsonb object with two writers. Clients
 * write free-form keys through `POST /sessions` and `PATCH /sessions/:id`
 * (`metadata`, documented as client metadata in `@kortix/sdk`). Server code
 * writes keys that later code TRUSTS: for attribution, credential minting,
 * channel reply targets, trigger routing, and data restore. A key in the
 * second group that a client can also write lets the client decide what the
 * server trusts.
 *
 * The rule: every key that server code reads for a decision is listed here,
 * and both routes refuse a request that names one (`400`). Add the key here in
 * the same change that adds the server reader.
