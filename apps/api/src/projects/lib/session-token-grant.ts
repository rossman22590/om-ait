/**
 * Reconcile a live session token's agent grant with the current manifest.
 *
 * `account_tokens.agent_grant` starts from the session's create-time agent.
 * The connector and Kortix-CLI gates (`agentMayUseConnector`,
 * `agentMayPerform`) read that row at call time. The row must therefore follow
 * both in-session agent switches and same-agent manifest edits:
 *
 *     create session with agent A (connectors: [slack])
 *     update A to connectors: [slack, google_workspace]
 *       -> the token still carries the old list unless it is reconciled
 *       -> the existing session receives connector_not_assigned
 *
 * Secrets are replaced through the pre-prompt env sync (see `secret-grant.ts`).
 * Nothing refuses a switch. Connector and CLI grants are checked against this
 * row at CALL time, so rewriting it genuinely re-scopes every subsequent call —
 * which is why the re-mint, not a refusal, is the mechanism that protects them.
 *
 * ── The rewrite is guarded by PROVENANCE (INC-2026-09-08-CONNECTOR-GATEWAY) ──
 *
 * Every grant now carries the manifest blob sha and commit it was derived from
 * (`AgentGrant.manifestRevision` / `manifestCommit`, stamped by
 * `withGrantProvenance`). A freshly derived grant REPLACES the stored one only
 * when it is a genuine manifest change:
 *
 *   1. Same blob, different grant → the grant is a pure function of the blob
 *      and the agent name, so this is a glitched read, not a change. KEEP the
 *      stored grant, log at error level.
 *   2. Commit is an ANCESTOR of the stored grant's commit → a stale mirror
 *      served an older manifest. KEEP the stored grant, log.
 *   3. Manifest unreadable on the gateway path → KEEP the stored grant (the
 *      last-known-good) instead of failing every connector call. The prompt
 *      path still fails closed (a prompt can be retried; a turn's every tool
 *      call cannot).
 *
 * Before this guard, one bad read — a session-wide `connectors: []` for a
 * declared `connectors: all` agent — took every connector away from a live
 * session, including the Slack channel the agent answers on, until an
 * unrelated prompt re-minted the row. The project had 59 such denials in the
 * week before the incident.
