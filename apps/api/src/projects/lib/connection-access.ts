/**
 * ONE access rule for a connector connection.
 *
 * A connector is a declared capability; it has no identity. An account
 * (`connector_connections` row) is an authorized identity on that service,
 * owned by the project (shared) or by one member (private). Reachability is a
 * property of the ROW, never of the connector.
 *
 * `connectors.authorization_strategy` used to decide this. It was a
 * connector-level mode that made the two owner types mutually exclusive, and it
 * was the direct cause of the original bug: a `user`-strategy connector had no
 * connect flow anywhere, because three separate call sites refused anything
 * that was not `project`. It is retired (the column stays, unread — see
 * migration `20260916182954570_revoke_unreachable_connector_connections`).
 *
 * Its one useful property — an unattended automation must never run as somebody's
 * personal account — moves onto the `member` row below. That is strictly better:
 * a trigger on a former `user` connector used to be able to use nothing at all,
 * and now uses the shared account when one exists while still never touching a
 * private one.
