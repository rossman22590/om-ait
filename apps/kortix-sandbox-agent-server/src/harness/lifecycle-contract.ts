/**
 * The lifecycle port, as a leaf module with no value imports.
 *
 * `harness.ts` re-exports these and adds the resolver, but it also value-imports
 * the OpenCode definition — so anything that imports `harness.ts` for a type
 * pulls the whole daemon (routes, config provider, its bun-only dependencies)
 * into its TypeScript program. `open-code/lifecycle.ts` is imported by
 * `apps/api` (managed-models drift tripwire) and must stay as light as the old
 * `opencode.ts` was: it takes the port from here.
