/**
 * Transcript structure — how a turn's parts become the rows a reader sees.
 *
 * Segmentation (bursts vs text vs standalone tools), same-family step
 * grouping ("Read 6 files"), burst summaries ("Working · N steps"), thought
 * merging ("Thought for 12s"), plain-language narration, the working-turn
 * resolver, compaction state, and message timestamps. Pure data → data, no
 * framework, so web and mobile render the same transcript from one source.
