    PAGING THE DURABLE TRANSCRIPT.

    exactly the window the mirror exists to cover. So in that window the
    controller holds no cursor, `hasOlder` is false, and the saved history
    stops at its first page however much more the server kept.

    The web transcript's scroll sentinel and the print drain
    (`load-entire-history.ts`) both already drive `loadOlder`/`hasOlder`, so
    routing the mirror through the same two values is what makes saved history
    scrollable and printable without either of them learning a second concept.

    Older windows hydrate with `source: 'cache'`, which is what keeps them
    safe: the store settles cache rows against the runtime's bounded tail and
    drops only the ones that tail COVERS. Rows older than it — everything paged
