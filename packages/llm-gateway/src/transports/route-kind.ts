/**
 * OpenAI's /v1/chat/completions rejects genuine reasoning-family models
 * (o-series, gpt-5.x) whenever BOTH function tools and a non-'none' reasoning
 * effort are present on the request:
 *
 *   "Function tools with reasoning_effort are not supported for gpt-5.5 in
 *   /v1/chat/completions. To use function tools, use /v1/responses or set
 *   reasoning_effort to 'none'."
 *
 * (observed live against api.openai.com — BYOK gpt-5.5/gpt-5.6 agent sessions
 * on sampleco.kortix.cloud, session 21c6cfd0-5157-4e78-9d26-4198656b1a81).
 *
 * This function is a pure ROUTING PREDICATE — it decides whether a request
 * needs OpenAI's Responses API instead of chat/completions; it does not
 * itself speak either wire protocol. The ai-sdk engine (transports/ai-sdk/
 * model.ts's `needsResponsesApi`, which calls this verbatim) is the sole
 * consumer: when this returns `'openai-responses'`, it builds a `.responses()`
 * LanguageModel instead of `.chat()` rather than forcing `reasoning_effort` to
 * 'none' and silently degrading reasoning quality for every tool-using
 * request. (A hand-written native openai-responses transport used to serve
 * this kind directly; it was retired once the ai-sdk engine became the sole
 * transport engine — see the PR that deleted transports/openai-responses.)
 *
 * Gated narrowly so this only ever affects the exact broken combination:
 *  - `descriptor.kind === 'openai-compat'` — never touches anthropic/bedrock/
 *    custom, and never an already-'openai-responses' descriptor (Codex
 *    chooses its own transport independently in descriptors.ts).
 *  - `descriptor.reasoning === true` — the SAME models.dev-derived capability
 *    flag #4814 uses to strip reasoning-restricted sampling params, so a
 *    non-reasoning OpenAI model (gpt-4o, gpt-4.1, ...) is never routed here.
 *  - `isGenuineOpenAiUpstream(descriptor.baseUrl)` — never for an OpenAI-
 *    compatible-but-not-genuine-OpenAI upstream (OpenRouter, Groq, Azure
 *    OpenAI, self-hosted vLLM/LiteLLM/Ollama), whose `/responses` surface (if
 *    it even has one) isn't this same wire contract.
 *  - the request actually hits the failing shape: function tools present AND
 *    reasoning_effort isn't explicitly 'none' (OpenAI's own error message
 *    says 'none' keeps chat/completions working) — so a plain reasoning-model
 *    turn with no tools, which already works fine today on chat/completions,
 *    is left completely alone, minimizing blast radius to exactly the broken
 *    combination instead of moving every reasoning-model request onto a
 *    different wire format (Responses doesn't translate every chat/completions
 *    field this codebase supports, e.g. response_format/json_schema — no
 *    reason to risk those paths when they aren't the ones that are broken).
 *
 * Called per-attempt from the ai-sdk engine (body is available there;
 * descriptor resolution in apps/api's resolveCandidates happens before the
 * body's tools/reasoning_effort are known to that layer) — cheap enough to
 * run on every dispatch, including each failover retry.
