# ── Project snapshot object store ─────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# One private bucket per environment for the S3 config provider
# (docs/runbooks/project-snapshot-s3.md). The API's leader worker publishes two
# immutable objects per (repo, commit) under
#   <prefix><owner>/<repo>/<sha>/<repo-id>/project-snapshot-v2/{manifest.json,
#   <sha256>.tree.tar.gz, <sha256>.blobs.pack}
# with conditional writes (If-None-Match: *) — nothing is ever overwritten.
# Sandboxes read through short-lived presigned GETs minted by the API task
# role; no credential for this bucket exists outside that role.
#
# Objects are derived data: the repository is the source of truth, and a
# missing object degrades a boot to the Git path (the descriptor re-queues the
# ledger row). That is what makes the expiration rule below safe.

#trivy:ignore:AVD-AWS-0089 Derived, short-lived snapshot objects; access is presigned GETs minted by the API task role, not worth a second log bucket.

  #checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_145:SSE-S3 by default so presigned sandbox downloads need no KMS context; kms_key_arn switches the bucket to a customer-managed key and the API task role is granted use of it (modules/ecs-api).
  #checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_18:Server access logging is not required for derived, short-lived project snapshots; every access is a presigned GET minted by the API task role and logged by CloudTrail data events when enabled.
  #checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_144:Snapshots are regional derived data rebuilt from Git on demand; cross-region replication is not required.
  #checkov:skip=CKV2_AWS_62:Snapshot objects have no event consumer; readiness lives in the API's ledger table.
