# Sandbox Enhancements

## Overview

This document outlines the enhancements made to the sandbox functionality in the OM-AIT platform, specifically focusing on file management capabilities for AI agent-generated content.

## New Functionality

### 1. File and Directory Download

A new API endpoint has been implemented to allow users to download files or directories from their sandbox environment:

```
GET /api/sandbox/{sandbox_id}/download
```

**Features:**
- Download individual files directly
- Automatically zip directories for download
- Proper content-type handling for various file types
- Authenticated access to ensure users can only download their own content

**Implementation:**
- Backend route in FastAPI that handles both file and directory download requests
- Directory zipping functionality that preserves folder structure
- Proper HTTP header management for downloads

### 2. File and Directory Deletion

A new API endpoint has been implemented to allow users to delete files or directories from their sandbox environment:

```
DELETE /api/sandbox/{sandbox_id}/delete
```

**Features:**
- Delete individual files
- Recursively delete directories and their contents
- Authenticated access to ensure users can only delete their own content
- Proper error handling and status reporting

**Implementation:**
- Backend route in FastAPI that handles both file and directory deletion
- Recursive directory removal with proper error handling
- Security checks to prevent unauthorized deletion

## Frontend Integration

The new sandbox functionality has been integrated into the user interface with:

- Download buttons for individual files in the file explorer
- "Download All" button for bulk downloads
- Delete buttons with confirmation dialogs to prevent accidental deletion
- Immediate UI updates after deletion to reflect changes

## Security Considerations

All sandbox operations maintain strict security controls:

- Authentication checks for all operations
- Verification that users can only access their own sandbox content
- Environment-aware permission handling (development vs. production)
- Enhanced logging for security-related events

## Benefits

These enhancements provide several key benefits:

1. **Improved User Experience**: Users can easily download and manage files created by AI agents
2. **Resource Management**: Users can clean up unnecessary files to save storage space
3. **Project Portability**: Downloaded files can be used in other environments or shared with team members
4. **Workflow Integration**: Makes it easier to incorporate AI-generated code into existing workflows

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements to consider:

1. Bulk selection and operations on multiple files
2. File renaming and moving capabilities
3. Direct file editing in the browser
4. File diff/comparison tools
5. Integration with version control systems
